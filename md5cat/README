The Perl scripts in this directory are used to maintain a file catalog
in a directory tree.

Contents:

chkmd5.pl   Maintain a checksum catalog in the current directory.
	    This currently requires the external program "checksum"
	    to actuall calculate checksums.

cmp2md5.pl  compares two checksum catalogs and does various things.

checksum    C program to calculate MD5 checksums;  this program
	    with it's supporting library functions can be found in
	    the module "checksum"

Examples:
1. generate the checksum in a writable directory tree:
   chkmd5.pl

2. generate the checksum in a read-only directory tree, e.g. CD-ROM:
   chkmd5.pl -cat /archive/catalogs/cdrom-0001.cat -tmp /tmp

3. remove duplicate files:
   cmp2md5.pl -discard -double _catalog

4. verify if all files from the target catalog are in a reference
   catalog:
   cmp2md5.pl -verify -ref /archive/catalogs/cdrom-0001.cat \
     -targ _catalog

5. remove all files from the target filesystem, when that file's
   checksum was found in the reference catalog and in the target:
   cmp2md5.pl -discard -ref /archive/catalogs/cdrom-0001.cat \
     -targ _catalog

Notes:
-verify does not complain about TRANS.TBL

Format of the catalog:

The catalog currently consists of lines in this format:
28c3532ce28488b35e5b474f400bfaf1 file     8433 chkmd5.pl

Each line contains four fields:
1. the MD5 checksum string
2. the entry type, currently there is only 'file'
3. the file size
4. the file's name

Things to do:
chkmd5.pl
+ Option -catalog should also imply -tmp unless otherwise specified.
  This is handy for taking the catalog of a read-only filesystem,
  e.g. a CD-ROM.

cmp2md5.pl
+ needs an option that explizitly lists all files that were not
  found in the reference catalog
